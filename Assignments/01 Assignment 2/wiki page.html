                        <p>Created in 2016 for my children suffering with eczema. </p>
                        <p>Today it is made to order, but I have hopes of being available in stores very soon.</p>
                    <li>Pop Ups</li>
                        <p>I'm currently looking for farmer markets to host a booth. I found a CBD smoke shop where I can sell my medicated shea butter.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Getting Started</strong></li>
                        <p>Moving into my first apartment.</p>
                    <li><strong>Recently</strong></li>
                        <p>Most recent project was desinging my son's bedroom and restroom. Making the move to Georgia I want them to be as comfortable as possible. I decorated their room with Naruto canvas' and neon lights. For their bathroom I tricked it out with Demon Slayer: Kietsu No Yaiba bath curtains and rugs.</p>
                    <li><strong>In the Future</strong></li>
                        <p>I plan to design my car. I have a Ford Fusion Hybrid and the body is nice. Not my bumper I kind of messed it up, but that's what intrigued me to fix it up and go all out. I plan to wrap it, black out the window, and get some rims.</p>
