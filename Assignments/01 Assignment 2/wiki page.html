                    <li><strong>My skincare line</strong></li>
                        <p>Created in 2016 for my children suffering with eczema. I use natural and organic ingredients, Shea Butter from Ghana, organic pressed coconut oil and organic avocado oil. I also make a medicated version with CBD.</p>
                        <p>Whipped shea butter is great all year round to protect you from the elements. In the summer cintronella oil can be infused to repel mosquitos. In the fall and winter seasons I like to add a warm vanilla and pumpkin spice scent.</p>
                        <p>Today it is made to order, but I have hopes of being available in stores very soon.</p>
                    <li><strong>Pop Ups</strong></li>
                        <p>I'm currently looking for farmer markets to host a booth. I found a CBD smoke shop where I can sell my medicated shea butter.</p>

            <h3><i>Being Outdoors</i></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Yoga</strong></li>
                        <p>I started practicing yoga seriously when I was pregnant with my twins. I did it to prepare for my body's drastic change it would have to go through. Yoga helped to strenghten me both physically and emotionally.</p>
                    <li><strong>Hiking</strong></li>  
                        <p>I first started hiking when I was in college. My biology teacher was the mayor of Huntington Beach and we would spend our class time in the outdoors. We hiked the Bosa Chika water basin where they have indigenious land preserve, and the Chapparal in the Pachanga indigenious land. My favorite to go to location is Runyon Canyon because you can hike with local celebrities.</p>

            <h3><i>Interior Design</i></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Getting Started</strong></li>
                        <p>I fell in love with interior design when I moved into my first apartment. I remember going to a million stores looking for the perfect couch. I'm an artist and color cordinating is a natural talent. I enjoying creating different vibes from gothic to modern design. One of my favorite inspirational shows is Tiny House Builds</p>
                    <li><strong>Recently</strong></li>
                        <p>Most recent project was desinging my son's bedroom and restroom. Making the move to Georgia I want them to be as comfortable as possible. I decorated their room with Naruto canvas' and neon lights. For their bathroom I tricked it out with Demon Slayer: Kietsu No Yaiba bath curtains and rugs.</p>
                    <li id="future"><strong>In the Future</strong></li>
                        <p>I plan to design my car. I have a Ford Fusion Hybrid and the body is nice. Not my bumper I kind of messed it up, but that's what intrigued me to fix it up and go all out. I plan to wrap it, black out the window, and get some rims.</p>
